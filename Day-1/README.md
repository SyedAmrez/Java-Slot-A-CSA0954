1)To sort the string in an alphabetical order. Using the method of string array and initialize 
the array and Count the length of the array. Using for loop, the strings are compared 
(compare to ()) and sorted. Print the sorted list of array in alphabetical order.
Sample Input: Madras, Delhi, Ahameabad, Calcutta, Bombay 
Sample Output: Ahameabad, Bombay, Calcutta, Delhi, Madras

2)Write a program to print the following pattern
Sample Input:
Enter the Character to be printed: % &, #
Max Number of time printed: 3
%
& &
# # #

3)Write a program to print the given number is Perfect number or not?
Sample Input:
Given Number: 6
Sample Output:
It’s a Perfect Number 

4)To write a java program to illustrate overriding of methods. Define a class base In the
base class define one constructor & one for display method Inherit a class sub from class
‘base’. Define constructor & pass argument. Get the value of one argument from the base
class. A method for display with the same name as that of in the base class. Define the
class override and main method in this class. Create the object of sub class & pass two
parameter
Sample Input and output:
Base x=100 Derived y=200

5)To write a java program that implements the multilevel inheritance. Define a class
student and Declare the variable roll no, marks. In the class student get the roll no of
students and Derive the class test from student class & declare the method get marks()
and Derive the class result from class test.
Sample Input and output:
Sample input marks: 75, 76, 56
Total Output marks: 207

6)To write a java program that counts the number of digit of the given number and catches
the exception if an alphabet is entered instead of a number.
Sample Input and output:
Enter an integer
345
Number of digits are3

7)Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
Sample Input and output:
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

8)Write a program to print number of factors and to print nth factor of the
given number.
Sample Input:
Given Number: 100
N = 4
Sample Output:
Number of factors = 9
4
th factor of 100 = 5

9)You are given an m x n binary matrix mat of 1's (representing soldiers) and 0's
(representing civilians). The soldiers are positioned in front of the civilians. That is, all
the 1's will appear to the left of all the 0's in each row.
A row i is weaker than a row j if one of the following is true:
The number of soldiers in row i is less than the number of soldiers in row j.
Both rows have the same number of soldiers and i< j. Return the indices of the k weakest
rows in the matrix ordered from weakest to strongest.
Example 1:
Input: mat =
[[1,1,0,0,0],
[1,1,1,1,0],
[1,0,0,0,0],
[1,1,0,0,0],
[1,1,1,1,1]],
k = 3
Output: [2,0,3]

10)Develop a programme that uses Multiple Inheritance concepts to compute a
student's grades in six subjects. The total and aggregate are then calculated, and the
student's grade is displayed. If the student achieves an aggregate of more than 75%,
the grade is Distinction. If the aggregate is between 60 and 75, the grade is First
Division. If the aggregate is between 50 and 60, the grade is Second Division. If the
aggregate is between 40 and 50, the grade is Third Division. Otherwise, the grade is
FAIL.
Sample Input & Output:
Enter the marks in python: 90
Enter the marks in c programming: 91
Enter the marks in Mathematics: 92
Enter the marks in Physics: 93
Enter the marks in Chemistry: 92
Enter the marks in Professional Ethics: 93
Total= 551
Aggregate = 91.83
Class: DISTINCTION

11) Write a program to print the below pattern
1
2 2
3 3 3
4 4 4 4
3 3 3
2 2
1

12)Write a program to generate 5 Random nos. between 1 to 100, and it should not follow
with decimal point.
