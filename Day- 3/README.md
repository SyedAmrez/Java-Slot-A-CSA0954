1) In an organization they decide to give bonus to all the employees on New Year. A 5% bonus
on salary is given to the grade A workers and 10% bonus on salary to the grade B workers.
Write a program to enter the salary and grade of the employee. If the salary of the employee
is less than $10,000 then the employee gets an extra 2% bonus on salary Calculate the bonus
that has to be given to the employee and print the salary that the employee will get.
Sample Input & Output:
Enter the grade of the employee: B
Enter the employee salary: 50000
Salary=50000
Bonus=5000.0
Total to be paid:55000.0

2) Write a program to enter the marks of a student in four subjects. Then calculate the total and
aggregate, display the grade obtained by the student. If the student scores an aggregate
greater than 75%, then the grade is Distinction. If aggregate is 60>= and <75, then the grade
is First Division. If aggregate is 50 >= and <60, then the grade is Second Division. If
aggregate is 40>= and <50, then the grade is Third Division. Else the grade is Fail.
Sample Input & Output:
Enter the marks in python: 90
Enter the marks in c programming: 91
Enter the marks in Mathematics: 92
Enter the marks in Physics: 93
Total= 366
Aggregate = 91.5

3) Write a program to calculate tax given the following conditions:
a. If income is less than or equal to 1,50,000 then no tax
b. If taxable income is 1,50,001 â€“ 3,00,000 the charge 10% tax
c. If taxable income is 3,00,001 â€“ 5,00,000 the charge 20% tax
d. If taxable income is above 5,00,001 then charge 30% tax
Sample Input:
Enter the income:200000
Sample Output:
Tax= 20000

4) Write a program to enter the marks of a student in four subjects. Then calculate the total and
aggregate, display the grade obtained by the student. If the student scores an aggregate
greater than 75%, then the grade is Distinction. If aggregate is 60>= and <75, then the grade
is First Division. If aggregate is 50 >= and <60, then the grade is Second Division. If
aggregate is 40>= and <50, then the grade is Third Division. Else the grade is Fail.
Sample Input & Output:
Enter the marks in python: 90
Enter the marks in c programming: 91
Enter the marks in Mathematics: 92
Enter the marks in Physics: 93
Total= 366
Aggregate = 91.5

5) Bank is a class that provides method to get the rate of interest. But, rate of interest may differ
according to banks. For example, SBI, ICICI and AXIS banks are providing 8.4%, 7.3% and
9.7% rate of interest. Write a Java program for above scenario.

6) Bring out the situation in which member names of a subclass hide members by the same name
in the super class. How it can be resolved? Write Suitable code in Java and
Implement above scenario with the Parametrized Constructor (accept int type parameter)
of the Super Class can be called from Sub Class Using super () and display the input
values provided.
Sample Input : 100, 200
Sample Output : 100, 200

7) Display Multiplication table for 5 and 10 using various stages of life cycle of the thread by
generating a suitable code in Java.
Sample Input 5, 10
5 X 1 = 5
5 X 2 =10
â€¦.
10 X 1 =10
10 X 2 = 20
â€¦.
